#  LangChain from python to other languages  

Langchain framework (Python) has rapidly gained success in the open source community because has been one of the first to provide a structured approach (the chain) to develop LLM powered and context-aware reasoning applications. This success is also evidenced by the number of ports to other programming languages like: 

Langchain.js (developed by the same company behind langchain ) 

Langchain4j, 

Langchain-swift  

 

# LangGraph comes to the play 

On  the jan 2024, langchain has announced LangGraph a module built on top of LangChain to better enable creation of cyclical graphs, often needed for agent runtimes.  LangGraph allows to build agents cooperation in a very simple and meaningful way enabling a new level of smart application based upon agent cooperation. 

 

# Why LangGraph for Swift 

Since I’m developing IOS app powered by LLM that needs Agents cooperation I’ve decided to develop and alter-ego of original LangGraph  project in Swift 

LangGraph for Swift is an Open Source project that is a porting of the original LangGraph project  into the Swift programming language. Like the original project, LangGraph for Swift is designed to work jointly with "LangChain for Swift" to provide AI developers with an easy way to create cyclical graphs, especially for creating AI agent cooperations. 

   

## LangGraph for Swift and LangChain for Swift 

LangGraph for Swift is designed to work seamlessly with LangChain for Swift, and to proof that , I’ve ported the AgentExecutor from LangChain for Swift to LangGraph where We can see the versatility and the powerful of this new approach 

  

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, LangGraph for Swift is an exciting new project that brings the power and flexibility of the original LangGraph project to the Swift programming language. By working jointly with LangChain for Swift, developers can easily create cyclical graphs and build advanced AI systems. We encourage developers to explore this new project and contribute to its growth and development.
