## Introduction

[GenAIScript] is an open-source scripting environment that integrates Generative AI capabilities directly into JavaScript, enabling developers to programmatically construct prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) and orchestrate their interactions with various tools and data sources. With seamless integration into Visual Studio Code, [GenAIScript] facilitates the ingestion of diverse document formats—such as PDFs, DOCX, and CSVs—and supports the generation of structured outputs, including files and edits. 
This functionality streamlines tasks that involve AI analysis  by automating complex processes within a cohesive scripting framework.  ￼
