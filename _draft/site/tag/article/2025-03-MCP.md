The rise of Model Context Protocol(MCP) as strategic  in building Agentic Architecture are becoming unstoppable, MCP seems bridge the gaps for developing scalable & reusable Agents application.

At beginning the **function-call** feature seemed immediately a disruptive feature that would give us the possibility to move from reasoning to acting (ReACT) in the AI powered applications. 

The idea behind the **function-call** standardization was that the callable actions were, conceptually, embedded within the agentic applications themselves. 

Since then, many ReACT-based agentic applications have been implemented that incorporate actions, until the announcement and release by the Cloude team of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that gave an innovative push to **function-call** promoting a new architecture for ReACT-based agentic applications that is more modern, reusable and scalable that, from my point of view, winks at the Cloud and Microservices, also  opening up to the possibility of marketplaces for LLM-aware actions (Agent Action Store).

In this article I do not want to explain (again) all the features of MCP or list all the available MCP servers, but I would like to explore a possible approach to reuse microservices already existing in the company or purchased from third parties to create agentic applications that can exploit all their potential.
