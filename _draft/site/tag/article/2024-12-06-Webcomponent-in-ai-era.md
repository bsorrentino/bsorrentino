The problem for every AI problem is create a complete and meaningful context on which the LLM can consistently work. 
In the code generation domain the AI are going to be a game changer and the challenges for the tools' makers are, again, to create the right context to produce the right code. Obviously the context in code could be very large and complex to create due, in parcular, to take in consideration a dependencies graph and the environment in which the code is going to be executed. 

In this way the webcomponent is a technology that push to have a well defined context in which the component has to work, minimizing the dependencies and make as much as possible the component environment agnostic.

This technology seems incredibly well-tailored to address the problem that code generation tools have in building a complex and comprehensive context that LLMs must reason about in order to generate the best possible code in the problem domain presented to them.
