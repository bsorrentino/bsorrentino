## Digital Transformation

Organizations are embracing an approach to cloud transformation and app modernization build on the understanding that:

* Some business challenges can be solved with custom software development… But there’s only so much of that in which you can invest.
* Some business challenges can be solved with Commercial-off-the-Shelf SaaS solutions… But there isn’t always an app for that.

Other these is rising a new approach that could coexists and complete the two ones above that is adopting at enterprise level  No-Code / Low-Code platform.  

Power Platform has to be considered "first class citizen" in the cloud transformation and app modernization journey for large organizations.
Indeed, the platform exists alongside Azure and Office 365 as one of Microsoft's "three clouds".
Power Platform is an enterprise-grade Business Platform for enterprise-grade workloads, its usage creates a comprehensive workplace shared among "entire" organization enabling and, in somehow, driving the “digital transformation”
