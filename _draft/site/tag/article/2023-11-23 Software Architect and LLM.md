In this video, Eric and Julie discuss the topic of large language models (LLMs) and how they can be used by architects. Eric starts by talking about his experience with chat GPT, a specific LLM, and how it helped him with his work as an architect. He explains that LLMs can be used to generate ideas, research patterns, and even write code. Julie then asks Eric to define what a large language model is and how prompt engineering works. Eric explains that LLMs are trained on massive amounts of data and that prompt engineering is the process of using specific prompts to get the desired output from an LLM. The two then discuss the importance of using LLMs responsibly and avoiding hallucinations, which are incorrect or misleading outputs from an LLM. The video ends with a preview of part two, where Eric and Julie will discuss specific examples of how architects can use LLMs.


Eric considered the use of large language models (LLMs) in the field of architecture. He believes that LLMs can be a valuable tool for architects, helping them to research, design, and implement architectural solutions. Specifically, Eric believes that LLMs can be used to:

* **Research architectural patterns and best practices.** LLMs can access and process vast amounts of information, including architectural documentation, research papers, and code repositories. This information can be used to identify relevant patterns and best practices for a particular architectural problem.
* **Generate creative architectural designs.** LLMs can be used to generate new and creative architectural designs. This can be done by providing the LLM with a set of constraints and requirements, and then asking it to generate a design that meets those constraints.
* **Implement architectural solutions.** LLMs can be used to generate code and documentation for architectural solutions. This can save architects time and effort, and can help to ensure that the solutions are implemented correctly.

Eric believes that LLMs are still in their early stages of development, but that they have the potential to revolutionize the field of architecture. He encourages architects to experiment with LLMs and to explore their potential for improving the way that architecture is practiced.

## In the video, Uli, another speaker, also shares his insights and considerations regarding the use of AI, specifically large language models like ChatGPT, in architecture and related fields. Here's a summary of Uli's key points:

1. **Prompt Engineering and Its Importance:** Uli emphasizes the concept of prompt engineering, which he describes as using human expertise within a specific domain to steer the AI model towards producing productive outputs. He explains that prompt engineering involves structuring a query in such a way that the AI model can provide the most accurate and relevant response based on the input question.

2. **Constraining the AI Model:** Uli discusses the necessity of constraining the AI model to get more precise and useful outputs. He notes that the knowledge corpus of these models is vast, encompassing human knowledge accumulated over thousands of years. Therefore, it's important to direct the AI to focus on specific areas or contexts to avoid overly broad and less useful responses.

3. **Using Personas in Prompts:** One of the strategies Uli mentions for effective prompt engineering is asking the model to assume a specific persona, like a software architect. This approach helps the AI model to logically switch its perspective and apply a set of constraints relevant to that persona, leading to more focused and deeper outputs.

4. **Hallucinations in AI:** While not elaborated in detail, Uli acknowledges the concept of hallucinations in AI, where the model might generate incorrect or nonsensical information. This is presented as a point of caution and an area that requires careful consideration when using AI models.
