## Introduction

In my experience using the **Power Platform** Iâ€™ve focused a great part
of effort in understanding and using its **ALM** that continue to evolve
providing very useful tools allowing to facilitate introduction of
Devops practices within the Microsoft low-code eco-system

## The Problem: Clone a Flow within Solution

During **Power Platform** development I use almost exclusively
**Solutions** and [Microsoft Power Platform CLI (aka PAC)] to manage
**ALM** and often I deal with problem to **clone a Flow within solution**.

So I've decided to search for a solution and I landed on this forum topic [Copy/Duplicate a Flow in a Solution]
that explain how to clone a flow once unpack solution using [PAC].
Since I've already [enhanced PAC in Nodejs using ZX], I started to implements a new feature in [zx-powerapps-cli].

## Solution: zx-clone-flow command from zx-powerapps-cli package

Now a new command `zx-clone-flow` is available from the latest version of [zx-powerapps-cli] package. 
Usage is very simple once exported a solution from Power Platform Cloud Environment to Local File system (e.g. local git repo)
using either the macro-command `zx-export-solution` or directly using
the [PAC]low level ones (`pac solution export` / `pac solution unpack`) it is enough run `zx-clone-flow` providing
**solution folder** and **flow json file** and **et voila'** the flow will be cloned. 
After that you have to import solution to Power Platform Cloud Environment from Local File system using either the macro-command
`zx-import-solution` or directly using the [PAC] low level ones (`pac solution pack` / `pac solution import`)

### Video

Below Iâ€™ve recorded a brief video that cover the entire cloning lifecycle from beginning to the end

## Conclusion

I hope this feature makes Flow development easier as it did for me, in
the meantime, happy programming and ... enjoy [zx-powerapps-cli]! ðŸ‘‹
