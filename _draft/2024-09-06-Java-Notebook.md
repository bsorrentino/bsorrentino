## The powerful of Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebooks are an excellent tool, originally developed to help data scientists and engineers to simplify their work with data using python programming language; in fact, the interactive nature of notebooks makes them ideal for quickly see the code results without setting up a development environment, compiling, packaging and so on. This particular feature has been crucial for adoption  in data science, machine learning, and statistical modeling where development skill was less essential than data manipulation expertise.

### Advantages

Below are some of the advantages of Jupyter notebook  

1. **Interactive Development**: Notebooks allow developers to write code in small chunks, test them immediately, and visualize results. This interactive workflow promotes faster iteration and debugging, ideal for data exploration, algorithm development, and quick prototyping.

2. **Rich Visualizations**: Typically Notebook are integrated with powerful visualization libraries that are able to display plots, graphs, and other visual outputs inline.
3. **Documentation and Code Together**: Notebooks combine executable code with markdown cells, allowing developers to document their code, explain logic, etc.., creating more readable and maintainable codebases.
4. **Collaboration**: By sharing notebooks, team members can review and run code without setting up a development environment, making collaboration easier, especially in cross-functional teams involving non-technical stakeholders.
5. **Reproducibility**: Notebooks can be rerun from top to bottom, ensuring that any analysis or test can be consistently reproduced. This is crucial for debugging, testing, or presenting results.

**Summarizing we can say that** 
> Jupyter notebooks streamline the development process, from initial exploration to production-ready code, offering flexibility and real-time feedback.

## Break the Python barrier

Considering the advantages that offer Jupyter notebooks, would be great for software developer use such notebook approach to develop, for example, **USE CASE TESTS** for projects  or providing useful **INTERACTIVE HOW-TO**.

**The question here is**: 
> IS IT POSSIBLE USE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK FOR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE OTHER THAN PYTHON ?

The answer is **YES**ðŸ¤©.

## The Jupiter Architecture

The Jupyter tools has been architected to support multiple programming languages though the **Kernel** concept
