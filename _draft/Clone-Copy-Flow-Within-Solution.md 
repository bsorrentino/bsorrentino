# Introduction 

In my experience using the [Power Platform] i've focused a great part of effort in undertanding and using its [ALM] that continue to evolve providing very useful tools allowing to facilitate introduction of Devopos practices within the Microsoft low-code eco-system

# The Problem: Clone a Flow In Solution 

During [Power Platform] development I use almost exclusively [Solutions] and [Microsoft Power Platform CLI (aka PAC)] to manage [ALM] and often I deal with problem to **clone a Flow in solution**. 
> Really the problem was also for **clone canvas app in solution** but lately in preview Microsoft ha released the feature [add canvas apps to solution by default]ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©.

So I've decided to search for a solution and I landed on this forum topic [Copy/Duplicate a Flow in a Solution] that explain how to clone a flow once unpack solution using [PAC] then, since I've already [enchanced PAC in nodejs using ZX], I started to implements a new feature of my [zx-powerapp-cli] for cloning in simpler way a Flow

# Solution: zx-clone-flow command from zx-powerapp-cli package

Now a new command `zx-clone-flow` is available from the latest version of [zx-powerapp-cli] package. Usage is very simple once exported a solution from Power Platform Cloud Environment to Local File system (local git repo) using either the macro-command `zx-export-solution` or directly using the PAC low level ones (`pac solution export` / `pac solution unpack`) it is enough run `zx-clone-flow` providing **solution folder** and **flow json file** and __et voila'__ the flow will be cloned. After that you have to import solution to Power Platform Cloud Environment from Local File system using either the macro-command `zx-import-solution` or directly using the PAC low level ones (`pac solution pack` / `pac solution import`)
