## Implementation

### 1. Setting up a Monorepo with Lerna

**What's Lerna and Why Use It?**  
Lerna is a popular tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages, known as monorepos. It makes handling projects with multiple interdependent packages a breeze, ensuring smooth management and versioning.

**Steps to Set Up Lerna**:
1. Start by installing Lerna globally:
```bash
$ npm install --global lerna
```

2. Initialize a new Lerna project:
```bash
$ lerna init
```
This will create a `lerna.json` in your directory and a `packages` folder where your individual app packages will reside.

3. Navigate to the `packages` directory and create your desired packages or integrate existing ones.

### 3. Building and Packaging with Tauri

**Building Your Web Tool Application**:  
Before you can package your application, it needs to be in a state ready for production. This means optimized, minified, and without development dependencies.

1. Navigate to your app's directory.
2. Run your build command. For many Node.js apps, this might be:
```bash
$ npm run build
```
Your build artifacts will typically be in a `dist` folder or similar.

**Packaging for MacOSX with Tauri**:  
With your app ready, you can now use Tauri to package it as a native MacOSX application.

1. Install Tauri CLI globally:
```bash
$ npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
```

2. Initiate a new Tauri project within your app's directory:
```bash
$ tauri init
```

3. Ensure you have the prerequisites for MacOSX as detailed in the Tauri documentation.

4. Build and package your app:
```bash
$ tauri build
```

After a few moments, you should have a native MacOSX application ready to go!
