## Unleashing AI Power Locally: Using LM Studio

### Introduction

In my experience dealing in developing AI powered applications using [langchain] framework, I arrived to need to involve a local LLM model. So I started searching for some guides or videos and at the end I landed on video: "[Run ANY Open-Source Model LOCALLY][video1]". Seeing this very interesting video I understood that in the rapidly evolving world of AI, open-source large language models have become increasingly accessible, and I discovered existence of LM Studio a freely downloadable tool designed to simplify the deployment and run of open-source large language models on local machines. Below I summarise the main features offered by LM Studio which enable users to quickly explore and test the ‚Äúopen-source LLM‚Äù‚Äôs world
