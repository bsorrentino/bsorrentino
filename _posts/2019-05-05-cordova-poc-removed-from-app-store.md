## Idea behind App

Five years ago Cordova POC landed on App Store. I developed this App firstly to help me to dealt with hybrid mobile programming, afterwards I has evolved its concept give it a more marketing meaning as state below:  

> Cordova-POC helps to do demo of your Cordova app to customer on-the-fly. Idea is to connect multiple sources (online & offline) from which download HTML5 application’s bundle. You can package your demo app as zip file and put it on Dropbox or develop it directly on JSFiddle downloading it when you ready. Moreover Cordova-POC collects the deployed applications, providing a personal applications gallery, always ready to run.

At that time was a pretty innovative idea, currently there are  a lot of app that allow to achieve similar goals.

However I've tried to keep such App updated with major Cordova releases in particular for the IOS version that gained hundreds of downloads (objectively not so many but a good achievement for me)

## The Reasons of Reject

Continuing to follow my strategy I had arranged a new release  making app  IOS 11.4 compatible and upgrading  cordova-ios runtime to 4.5.5 but after I submitted for review Apple has rejected the app for the following reasons:

> Your app appears to be designed for clients or users to preview apps prior to being submitted to the App Store for review. This type of design allows you to change your app’s behavior or functionality to differ from the intended and advertised primary purpose of your app, which is not in compliance with App Store Review Guideline 2.5.2 and section 3.3.2 of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.

And, after a while, for such reasons they has removed  the App from Sale.

## Conclusion

I've spoken with Apple's support trying to explain that the App was not for test purpose but mostly to help developers to provide a showcase of their apps but evidently it has not been enough.

So I've decided to write this post to explain to people that downloaded the app and potential ones, the reasons why there will be not future versions of such App.

That's all. I would want to say thanks to everyone having downloaded app trusting my work and giving me confidence to go ahead
