# PlantUML meets OpenAI on iPad

## <u>ChatGPT</u> and the rise of [AI] for everyone

Currently after that [ChatGPT] hase been unveiled to the world seems that nothing has more sense without an integration with the artificial intelligence ([AI])

Someone are worried about [AI] domination and they would want suspend its wide usage, others instead try to use it to provide the next generation of services and tools.

### <u>self-pilot</u> vs <u>co-pilot</u>

I think that stopping the development of artificial intelligence will be difficult, but we need a sort of [AI] governance, my opinion is:

> the [AI] must not be used in **self-pilot** mode, rather it should be used in **co-pilot** mode in which the human brain is always involved in the final decisions.

Using [AI] to help work amplifying your effectiveness, could be one of the main goals of the next future for  services and tools developers, so the challenge should be to identify the possibly use cases allowing to express the power of the cooperation with Artificial Intelligencex.

## <u>PlantUML</u> as an [AI] use case

So i've embraced this challenge trying to enhance my "[PlantUML App fo iPad][PlantUMLapp]" to give the possibility to create and/or update [PlantUML] diagrams using [AI].

> For who doesn't know [PlantUML] it is a tool belong to **diagram-as-code** category that is an **open-source tool allowing users to create diagrams from a plain text language**.

I've started with an experimental branch using [OpenAI] api through the swift package [OpenAIKit] with the  "**Text-Davinci-Edit-001**" Model and **honestly I was really surprised by the Incredible results obtained** üò≤

## Conclusion

The new release of the [PlantUML App fo iPad][PlantUMLapp] with [AI] integration is still in development but I couldn't wait to share with you the first amazing outcomes. for this reason, I've realized a short [video] that contains a simple but meaningful use case
