### Why I needed to do it


Lately I’ve dealt with an [issue]  on my project [cordova broadcaster] plugin


I’ve fixed it, committed and published to NPM  the new release of plugin.


I was happy for contribution and also because I had quickly answered to the request, but, after a while,  I received following comment on such issue:


> Changes look good.
>
> Fyi to reference an issue in a commit message you should use the  syntax fixes #10 instead, so that the commit will actually be referenced in the issue feed.


**So … I forgotten to comment, in the right way, the related commit and I have already pushed all** … damn! 🙁


Then I’ve started to search for a solution and “googling” I got a lot of results related to fix last commit using amendment ( `—amend`).


After a bit, finally, I found it on [SuperUser] and, once applied, the [commit]’s comment is, magically updated in the right way.


> … Just one word: **“Awesome”**.


So .. I would share with you the procedure just in case you have to deal with this situation.  Such procedure is also known as rebase commits against a point in time

### Rebase commits against a point in time

Checkout the master branch and perform a git rebase as shown below

```
$ git rebase -i <commit hash you want to change>^
```

This start a process for rebasing commits against a point in time and will open your default editor (usually `vi`) with a list of commits and actions (see [here][rebase] for each one. By default, the action is `pick` that means: _include such commit_.

* For any commit you wish to change the message, change from `pick` to `reword`. After that, save and close editor (in **vi** `:wq`).

* For each commit, you'll get an editor to edit the commit message. Change it as you see fit, save and close editor  (in **vi**  `:wq`).

Once you're done editing all the commit messages, you'll return to the command prompt, and have a new tree with the updated messages.
You can now upload them to github by using:

```
git push origin --force.
```

**Et voilà … you got expected result**


### Conclusion

However git never ends to amaze me, I didn’t know such feature related to rebasing process but I think that there are a lot of git’s gems that I ignore.


I can’t image to work without git anymore
