## Microsoft Power Platform


Lately I've had the chance to use the Microsoft **Power Platform** the **low-code platform that spans Office365, Azure, Dynamics365 and standalone applications**.

As Developer the prefix **low-code** to the word **platform** has not facilitate my first approach to it, but considering that this is the **one of the three pillars in the "_Microsoft Cloud Strategy_"**, I've started to use Power Platform as a new professional challenge.

After a while I've understood the incredible potential behind such platform and also the role that it could play in the organizations that are dealing with **"_Cloud / Digital Transformation_"**.

For this reason I  would like to start writing my experience  in this journey discovering  Power Platform.
As usual the best strategy is to start reusing as much as possible stuff from community and matter experts so below that are a collections of useful links where we can start to unveil this new world  behind Power Platform
