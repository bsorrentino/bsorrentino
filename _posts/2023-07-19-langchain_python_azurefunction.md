I've published the first [Azure Function] with [langchain] and [python] language, using [Azure OpenAI] ðŸ¥³. 

The fast(est) way of doing it, is fork/clone the awesome project [function-python-ai-langchain](prj) directly from [Azure Samples] that provide also a complete [infrastructure-as-code] based upon [bicep] ready to go.
