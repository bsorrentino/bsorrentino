## The last trend, from Java to Javascript 

Iâ€™ve developed a lot with Java (until java 8) but lately I'm progressively, for several reasons, moving to other programming languages with a prevalence of JavaScript.  

Yes, this means that Iâ€™m becoming a full stack developer using, mainly, ionic/angular for front-end development and [nodejs] for back-end development.  

### Use typescript as an enhanced Javascript 

Really, more than working with JavaScript, I use [typescript] that I consider a must-use for developing on javascript-aware environment/runtime. 

> A deep dive in [typescript] is not the objective of this article, for now consider [typescript] an enhanced JavaScript that transpile itself in pure javascript so when weâ€™ll use the [typescript] word will imply that being the scene there is javascript 

## The Enterprise dilemma - Javascript on back-end 

However, in my opinion javascript/angular/[nodejs] is a great technology stack but, working as consultant in Enterprise projects, there is a resistance to move back-end out of Java space (ie. comfort zone) because they want preserve know-how and reuse all the java stuff that they have selected/developed/tested during projects lifecycle  

 

In any case also for the enterprise, although mainly for front-end development, the javascript know-how are becoming rapidly a must-have so in this context from a while my dilemma has become: 

1. Is it possible move to javascript preserving/reusing all the selected / developed / tested java stuff? 
   > The answer here is YES, by using Nashorn that is   javascript on JVM. Nashorn is the new JavaScript Engine embedded in Java 8 that runs on the JVM. 

2. Is it possible develop a complete and well structured  javascript application ? 
   > Yes it is, but with help of  [typescript] that fills language's gaps and produce  javascript as output 

3. Is it possible to have a module system that allow to arrange application in separate well-defined modules ? 
   > Yes it is, this is achieved by project jvm-npm that enable use of commonJS and then [typescript] Modules 

4. Is it possible to keep the same productivity achieved developing in java by using IDE like Eclipse ?  
   > The answer here is not so simple at all because we have to define what we mean as productivity. In this case Iâ€™ve considered just the IDE features provided to develop code and in particular the intellisense one. So, after such assumptions, the question become:
   >  
   > **Is it possible to have an IDE with intellisense capability that is able to inspect java/javascript classes during development ?**
   >
   > For answer to the last question and  accomplish all the points Iâ€™ve developed the [Java2Typescript] project. 

## The Java2typescript project 

**Diagram of solution**

![Diagram](../../../../assets/java2ts/java2ts1.png)

**The projectâ€™s purposes are:** 

* To generate [typescript] Declarations enabling every typescript-aware IDE (eg. Atom, VSCode)  the IntelliSense feature that makes more comfortable access to Java features/classes from  javascript. 

* Introduce typescript/javascript code in java project to handle particular use cases that could require dynamic evaluation, extensibility or rapid prototyping 

It uses a [java annotation processor][jsr269] that scans the given classes from projectâ€™s classpath and generate the equivalent [typescript] declarations that make possible to develop an application in an assisted way using a preferred [typescript] enabled IDE.  

Developing application in such way you can: 

1. Reuse javascript/typescript know how  
1. Reuse all preexisting Java stuff 
1. Possibility to reuse some javascript stuff (eg. npm packages like [mustache]) 
1. Use an Object oriented & type safe language (ie. typescript) 
1. Enable Modularization 

### When use it 

Currently Iâ€™m using it mostly for playground and testing purposes continuously refining/improving to make it production ready. 

I think that the best use cases are for unit & integration tests but it could be very useful to develop simple workflow (or extension points) that could be updated at run time increasing configurability and extensibility of your app 

Iâ€™ve realized also a [Demo app][demo] available on line that has been developed using [typescript] on jvm provided by this project itself ([dogfooding]). The code is available [here][Java2Typescript]   

 
## Conclusion 

Hope this project could help you to think about the possibility to introduce usage of javascript in your Java applications, enabling it in an easy and effective way. I hope you enjoyed this article and found it useful for your own projects, in the meanwhile, enjoy coding! ðŸ‘‹Â
